    <h3>1. Data file must be a csv file. The column with the sgRNA sequences must be named 'sgRNA' and the column with the
    labels must be named 'label'.</h3>
    <h3>2. For training and comparison, data file must have two columns. One column for sgRNA sequence
    and the other for label (1/0). The sgRNA sequence must be 20-mer with NGG PAM sequence at the end resulting in a 23-mer sequence.
        Check this sample <a href="{% url 'prediction_models:download_training_example' %}">file</a>.
    </h3>
    <h3>3. For prediction, data file should have one column for sgRNA sequence. The sgRNA sequence must be 20-mer with NGG PAM sequence at the end resulting in a 23-mer sequence.
        Check this sample <a href="{% url 'prediction_models:download_prediction_example' %}">file</a>. However, to see other statistics
        upload a file with two columns.
